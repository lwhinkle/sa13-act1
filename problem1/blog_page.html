    <h3>My Big Orange Cat</h3>
    <p>I have a big orange cat named Rigby. Though he is not fat, he just happens to be large in size. He loves lounging around the house and spending time with people.</p>

    <h3>My Tiny Baby Kitty</h3>
    <p>Another one of my cats is named Stella. She is the opposite of Rigby, as she is very small in size, even her tail is small. She loves playing with other cats and meowing at three in the morning.</p>
